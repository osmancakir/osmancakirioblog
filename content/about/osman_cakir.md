I try to get (and give) as much as love, laughter and also an understanding how things work and evolve. I help organizing a Turkish [film festival](https://tuerkischefilmtage.de/) in Munich. I like [djing old vinlys](https://soundcloud.com/soureditor) from different cultures' music. My favourite activity is sitting on a bench somewhere in the city listening to the wave of thoughts in my mind quietly while enjoying my coffee. These moments then become what I write about. 


I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at Yildiz Technical University in Turkey with the 2nd highest GPA. Then I earned an M.Sc. in Economics Degree from Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. I am now trying to understand how cultural heritage is shaping the experience of living throughout the history of mankind with the help of data science methods.
