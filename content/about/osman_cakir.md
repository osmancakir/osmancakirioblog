As someone with diverse interests, I am trying to maintain a peaceful life with lots of books, films, a little bit music on the side. Without comparing myself to anyone, I try to get (and give) as much as love, laughter and an understanding how things work and evolve around me. I help organizing a Turkish [film festival](https://tuerkischefilmtage.de/) in Munich. I like djing electronica/downtempo music with melodic warmth. My favourite activity is sitting on a bench somewhere in the city listening to the wave of thoughts in my mind quietly while enjoying my coffee. These moments then become what I write about. 

I worked in many jobs to pay my bills and to earn my bread and butter. Such job experiences include; working as a bicycle courier at [Foodora](https://www.foodora.de/en/?r=1), being a stage crew at [Bavaria Film](https://www.bavaria-film.de/) and being a counter at public transportation at [PTV Group](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/). 

For data analysis and coding related experiences, so far, I  helped a small electronics wholesale company in Augsburg to expand their online sales channels and did an internship at [Fogra Research Institute](https://www.fogra.org/en/) where I built a data dashboard to track the renewal dates of the color print certifications provided by the institution. 

All of these experiences, have taught me, to show up on time and be responsible, providing quality-oriented service, the importance of being cooperative and getting the job done when the deadline is tight, as values.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at Yildiz Technical University in Turkey with the 2nd highest GPA. Then I earned an M.Sc. in Economics Degree from Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. I am now trying to understand how cultural heritage is shaping the experience of living throughout the history of mankind with the help of data science methods.
