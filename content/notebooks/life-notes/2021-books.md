Happy new year, and welcome to one of my new year's resolutions. This one is for reading books. Since I have found a job, I am slowly starting to feel like I am breathing again. As this feeling grows in me, all my dreams about living a simple, peaceful and at least not unhappy life are coming back to me. This year I am going to read a book every day. Number of books I read not mean much but my aim is to read 50 books. German and English books are included. --spoiler alert -- I also write a few words about the book. Let's start; 

 <h6>1 / 50 - Stefan Zweig - Scarlet Fever - 67 pages - Translated From German to Turkish by Regaip Minareci - 01.01.2021</h6>

Berger, A young man just moved to Vienna to study medicine. His friends Schamarek and Karla and a little girl. The idea of 18 year old uni student falling in love with a 12-13 year old girl is a bit creepy now. However this should be judged from the era of its time. Most of insecurities of young boys' when it comes to relationships with woman are still relatable. Not knowing how to behave, express interest, flirt. Emotionally not grown up in a grown up body. Manifesting to feeling unworthy, lonely, not manly. 

<h6>2 / 50 - Stefan Zweig - Letter from an Unknown Woman - Translated from German to Turkish by Ahmet Cemal - 02.01.2021</h6>

An attractive fuckboy writer and a little girl who fell in love with him without his knowledge. Then later the girl become obsessed with him. Emotional garbage accumulated. Derived, unhealthy pride. Consistent and loyal to her virtues and bearing all of the suffering caused by them. Deserving respect with a question mark; why not ever trying to communicate openly? Offended for life. Expectations from other people.

<h6>3 / 50 - Yevgeni Zamyatin - We - Translated from Russian to Turkish by Fatma & Serdar Arikan - 06.01.2021</h6>

Translation was terrible, I guess. I don't know. I feel like a very inspiring science fiction idea lost its readability. It felt very dry, not flowing. Maybe I will try to read it in English to compare in the future. I felt the same clunky reading feeling for the One Billion Years to the End of the World by Strugatskyies. Maybe this proud publisher of the first Turkish translation from russian did not do a good job.
