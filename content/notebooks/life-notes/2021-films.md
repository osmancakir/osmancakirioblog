Happy new year, and welcome to one of my new year's resolutions. This one is for watching films. Since I have found a job, I am slowly starting to feel like I am breathing again. As this feeling grows in me, all my dreams about living a simple, peaceful and at least not an unhappy life are coming back to me. 

This year I am going to watch an ambitious number of films and I will try to be as honest as I can to rate and review them. Some of them will be wrong and misjudged because of my ignorance and maybe even my bad taste. 

But I want to be really free from any critics view, imdb score etc. It is just going to be how I feel and think about the film. 

- I am not going to praise a film due to its camera, angle etc. innovations for it's time. 
- I won't be praising a film due to it's historical importance for the film art. 

I will be only focusing on what impressed me the most in the film; 

- whether I find it is boring or not, 
- whether it moved me emotionally with it's screenplay, 
- whether it made me think of something deep enough to have a moment of silence; my life, family, friends, past, future, anything. 
- Whether it inspired me an idea, feeling, experience. 

Hard to explain this. I think the word I am looking for is something like Robert M. Pirsig's concept of "quality" or maybe sincerety, as in the sense of putting honest work and effort to stay true to the idea of the film and managing to be not to be boring at the same time.   

--spoiler alert -- Please read reviews and grading at your own risk. Let's start; 

<h6> 1 - Cleo from 5 to 7 - Agnes Varda - 1962 - France - 01.01.2021</h6>

Grade : 2 / 5 - a bit boring, slow.

The most beautiful part to me is seeing Paris in the 60s. And that scene with Cleo's friend where she is posing nude for sculptors. The sculptures at the gallery were also looking interesting. It is the french sculptore [Robert Couturier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Couturier_(sculptor))'s Atelier. The dialogue for posing nude was impressive.

In general, the dialogues weren't very inspiring or impressive to me.
