My roommate and I started a small project about wine drinking. I used to be more of a beer person until I met her. She is good at picking good Wines and thanks to her I realized that actually a good wine is really enjoyable to drink.

And most importantly I started to realize that you don't need to pay a lot to have a really good wine at your table.

Here I will present the wines we tried and grade them. Our scale is :

- 5 star : oh mon dieu! What is this wine, where can I find it, how much does it cost? level of enthusiasm
- 4 star : able to get nice comments at a birthday party of a friend of a friend.
- 3 star : There is nothing to celebrate, but it feels good that we have wine to drink now.
- 2 star : okay, this wine is out of the list
- 1 star : oh poor grapes, tortured to become this?

Our general rules for a good wine are: 

- It is better if the wine is produced with a standard: For example Italian Wines with DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita), DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), IGT (Indicazione Geografica Tipica)

- It is better if the wine is a dry one. 

- It is better if the wine is not fruity etc.
