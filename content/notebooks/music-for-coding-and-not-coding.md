A growing full-albums, live shows, dj-sets I like to listen while coding and also not coding. Please don't hesitate to suggest me yours. You can send me your favourites by the [contact form](https://osmancakir.io/#contact) or by [twitter.](https://twitter.com/osmancakirio) If the link gets broken, you can probably find it from another youtuber if you search the title. The list is not so well ordered and there isn't a specific genre focus. If you don't like one, just try the next.
