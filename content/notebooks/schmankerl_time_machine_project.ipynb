    "> Always the same dishes on your dining table? Are you desperately looking for some inspiration for your culinary everyday life? So not all hope is lost yet! <br /> <br /> \"Schmankerl Time Machine\" invites you to a culinary time travel through the traditional history of Munich-based restaurants during the past 150 years. First get an overview of Munich's gastronomic legends. Next compose your unforgettable menu from a portfolio consisting of more than 380 menus. Recipes are already linked to them. How about a lobster cocktail, followed by a rabbit in the terrine and some venison nuts, finaly crowned by Prince Pückler's ice cream variation? Let yourself be inspired by the suggestions of other users when creating your menu. Upload the menu of your favourite Munich restaurant to expand the data collection even further.\n",
