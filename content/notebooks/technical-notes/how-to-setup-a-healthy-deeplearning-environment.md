I know it is going to be another tutorial on installing stuff. But this cumbersome work seems to not to go out of fashion soon. And it is intimidating to install complex libraries, managing your environments. An environment that is running without any error yesterday, might leave you with dead kernels today. 

In the last month I needed to set up deep learning environments for 3 different machines and since how I did is still fresh in my mind, I would like to share it with you. I can not guarentee it will work for you at the time you are reading this but I will provide as much as detail I can, so maybe you will get a better idea solving your setup issues.
